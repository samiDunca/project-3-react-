Project 3, built on top of Project 2: a single-page application built with React and React-Router. The app uses the backend from project 2 to perform CRUD operations through REST API.

Other skills learned:
- basic git (all the projects are on github)
- debugging using Chrome Developer Tools (sau Safari, depinde ce ai folosit)
- testing API with Postman
- learning and working on my own
- asking good questions
- supporting other people
